This repository contains the GUI-based front-end for the SmartCGMS software framework. It makes use of the Qt framework to allow for an efficient and fast configuration of the filter chain as well, as executing the filter chain and observing the results. Moreover, it supports parameter optimization with interactive filter selection and algorithm configuration.
